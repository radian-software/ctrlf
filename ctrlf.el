;;; Commentary:

;; CTRLF (pronounced "control F") is an intuitive and efficient
;; solution for single-buffer text search in Emacs, replacing packages
;; such as Isearch, Swiper, and helm-swoop. Taking inspiration from
;; the widely-adopted and battle-tested ctrl+F interfaces in programs
;; such as web browsers, but following the flow and keybindings of
;; Isearch, CTRLF improves on existing text search solutions in
;; convenience, robustness, and consistency.

;; Please see https://github.com/raxod502/ctrlf for more
;; information.

- `:translator': function which takes your query string and
  returns a regexp, e.g. `regexp-quote' for a literal search.
- `:case-fold': function which takes your query string and

reasons why multiple `after-string' overlays at the same point do
not behave well. One is that in some cases overlay priorities are
not considered correctly when Emacs decides which string to show
first. Another is that multiple `after-string' overlays with
`cursor' properties on their strings will cause the cursor to
render between them rather than at the position indicated by the
highest-priority overlay.

Note that this function is a horrifying hack which cannot

STYLE controls the search style. If it's unset, use the value of

`ctrlf--backward-p'. FORWARD does the same but the meaning of its
argument is inverted. BOUND, if non-nil, is a limit for the
search as in `search-forward' and friends. BOUND can also be the
symbol `wraparound', meaning keep searching at the beginning (or
end, respectively) of the buffer, rather than stopping. If the
search succeeds, move point to the end (for forward searches) or
beginning (for backward searches) of the match. If the search
fails, return nil, but still move point. Otherwise, return
