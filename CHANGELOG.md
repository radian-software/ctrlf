# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog].

## Unreleased
### Enhancements
* It is now possible to use the standard Isearch bindings within the
  minibuffer to search the current user input and the minibuffer
  history. Note that this functionality is not compatible with
  Selectrum. See [#41].
* We now disable `blink-matching-paren` automatically when entering
  CTRLF, because (for some reason) it uses `sit-for` to display its
  blink and this of course causes search results to be delayed
  ([#45]).
* Make the ctrlf fuzzy related functions autoload. See [#50].

### Bugs fixed
* CTRLF previously caused an error during Emacs startup unless the
  `map` library was already loaded. This has been fixed ([#49]).
* Several corner cases relating to minibuffer overlays have been fixed
  by improving the generality of the overlay management code ([#46]).
